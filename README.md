# E-Contract

Certainly, an e-contract refers to a contract that is formed electronically, without the need for a physical signature. It is a legally binding agreement created through electronic means, such as email, website forms, or electronic signatures. E-contracts have become increasingly popular due to the convenience and speed they offer compared to traditional paper-based contracts.
